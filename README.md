Coding Function Apps in Azure and deploying via Actions

Contains two Primary functions
1. Database Query and Save. This function queries my database for its current contents and saves the results to a txt file.
2. Analyse and Email. This function gathers current results with previous results and relays it to the OpenAI API for analysis. It then emails the response to me.

This repo also contains the above but broken down into smaller pieces.
